# 🌫️ Air Pollution Trends in Indian Cities - Data Analysis Project

## 🎯 Objective

The primary objective of this project is to analyze **air pollution trends across Indian cities** by studying various pollutant concentrations, their correlations, and seasonal as well as geographic variations. The analysis is intended to **identify high-risk areas** and emphasize the **need for targeted interventions** to improve public health and air quality.
